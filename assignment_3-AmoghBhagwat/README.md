# Assignment 3
(To be done in groups)

Take a pair of stationary stocks (only stocks listed on NSE) you found in assignment 2 and generate entry and exit signals on long and short positions on both the stocks using the Z-score graph (as discussed in the last meet).Use different levels of standard deviations (+/- 1 , +/- 1.5, +/-2 SD etc.) for these signals and see their effect on returns, and plot the returns. Take your capital to be 50,00,000 INR. You can also test your strategy using different capital and see if it has any effects on the returns. Take the testing period to be 01-06-2022 to 31-05-2023.

Deadline is 9th June EOD.

Note: At any point in your testing period the capital should never be negative.
